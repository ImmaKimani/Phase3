Tanzania Wells Water Pump Prediction

Overview

Tanzania, as a developing country, struggles with providing clean water to its population of over 57 million people. While many water points have been established, some require repairs or have failed altogether. The objective of this project is to help the government and NGOs efficiently allocate resources to maintain and repair water points, ensuring clean and reliable water access for communities.

Problem Statement

Access to clean water is critical for public health, agriculture, and daily life. However, many water pumps in Tanzania fail due to poor maintenance, lack of resources, or environmental factors. Identifying which pumps are functional, non-functional, or functional but in need of repair can help authorities make data-driven decisions on resource allocation and infrastructure improvement.

Objectives

The main goal of the project is to predict the functionality of water pumps in Tanzania using data-driven methods. By doing so, we aim to:

Improve water access for communities.

Assist the government and NGOs in efficient resource allocation.

Reduce operational inefficiencies and failures of water pumps.

Dataset

The dataset contains information on various water points across Tanzania, including:

Geographical location (latitude, longitude, region, district, etc.)

Water source type and quality

Pump type and operational status

Management details (who operates and maintains the pump)

Construction year and installer information

Approach

The project follows a data science workflow:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and handling missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding data distributions and key factors.

Feature Engineering – Creating meaningful features for better predictions.

Model Selection & Training – Applying machine learning models to predict pump functionality.

Evaluation & Optimization – Improving model performance using various metrics.

Deployment – Providing insights for decision-making.
